**BUDGETY**

The JavaScript Program, *budgety*, was a class project from a Udmey JavaScript Course.

The JavaScript program presented was coded by me from course materials. I am including
my course notes on this program.

I take complete notes when taking a course, while much of the material is from the course,
I make my observations in the text also. It is how I study material. I have found writing
down all the information instead just reading improves my comprehension and retention.

One further note, the CSS and HTML was provided.  I have already bought the courses for
these subjects. I have experience with HTML, before Markdown I wrote all my documents
in HTML. 

The document is written in MARKDEEP which is easily available online. It allows diagrams
to be created.
